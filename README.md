## Problem
Smart contract testing is difficult and takes too much time.

## Improvement goal
* It is easier to access (no-install, like myetherwallet).
* You can test contracts deployed on ganache-cli as easily as possible.
* UX is designed to be easy to test and use.
* It is practical as a test tool.
* Reduce development and testing time for Smart Contract and dapp
